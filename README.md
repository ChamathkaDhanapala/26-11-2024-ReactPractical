# React Router Login-Dashboard Application

This project is a simple React application that implements a login page with routing to a dashboard using `react-router-dom`. It also includes components for "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages for further expansion.

## Features

- **Login Page**: Users can enter credentials to log in.
- **Routing**: Navigation between pages (`Login`, `Dashboard`) is managed using `react-router-dom`.
